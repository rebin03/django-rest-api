- method: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
- body: datas
- headers: credential


HTTP Methods:
-------------

- GET : to read data
- POST: Create 
- PUT | PATCH: Update data
- DELETE: Delete a data item


=> HTTP Status Codes:

1xx - informational
2xx - Success
3xx - Redirection
4xx - Client error
5xx - Server error


SERIALIZERS
-----------

- Serializers allow complex data such as querysets and model instances to be converted to native Python datatypes that can then be easily rendered into JSON, XML or other content types. 

=> Serialization:
	- Convert querysets and model instances to python native data types

=> Deserialization:
	- Convert python native data types to queryset

- The serializers in REST framework work very similarly to Django's Form and ModelForm classes.

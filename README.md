# Django REST API

This repository contain api projects that I have created to learn and practice Django REST Framework (DRF) concepts.

## Topics Covered

- **Basic CRUD Operations**: Implementing Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities using DRF.
- **Serialization**: Transforming complex data types like Django models into JSON and vice versa.
- **API Endpoints**: Designing and implementing RESTful API endpoints.
- **Authentication and Permissions**: Experimenting with various authentication methods (Token, Session, JWT) and permissions.
- **Generic Views and ViewSets**: Simplifying API views with DRFâ€™s generic classes and ViewSets.
- **Pagination**: Managing large datasets with pagination techniques.
<!-- - **Throttling and Rate Limiting**: Controlling API request rates for security and performance.
- **Error Handling**: Managing exceptions and providing meaningful error responses.
- **Testing APIs**: Writing unit tests for API endpoints. -->

## Learning Goals

- Understand the fundamentals of building APIs with Django REST Framework.
- Gain hands-on experience with API development and testing.

## Usage

Access the API locally and test endpoints using tools like `Postman` or `curl`.
